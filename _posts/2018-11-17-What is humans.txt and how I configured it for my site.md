## What is humans.txt?

Humans.txt is a text file that contains information about the people behind building the website. It is created to know who the authors of the site are and also to give thanks to other people who contributed to the development of the website. It can for example contain information about the developer, the web designer or the SEO. It is up to you who should be listed as authors and who should receive a thank you.

## How I configured it for my site

I created a humans.txt file in the root of my site in which I wrote my information in and also when the site was last updated, which IDE I used and the doctype of the site. I referenced this text file from a link tag in the head.html file in the _includes folder so it shows up on every page on the site.
