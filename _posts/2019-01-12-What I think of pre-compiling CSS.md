## What is a CSS preprocessor?

A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS. This is then compiled into regular CSS syntax using the preprocessor. The CSS preprocessor used on this site is Sass.

Pros:
- Reusable DRY CSS with mixins
- Variables - No need to repeat the same value over and over.
- Easier and better organized
- Calculations can be done in the CSS
- Cross browser compatibility

Cons:
- Harder to debug
- More complex
- Increased building time

### Conclusion

There is no question about that a CSS preprocessor offers a lot of extras that allows you to write more flexible and maintainable CSS. The abstraction using variables and mixins adds much functionality and offers you solutions that you can't do in CSS alone. This results in quicker and easier development. I think that once you have tried using a CSS preprocessor, you will most likely never go back to vanilla CSS.
