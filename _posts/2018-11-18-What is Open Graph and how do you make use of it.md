## What is Open Graph?

Open Graph is a protocol that enables developers to let their web pages become rich objects in a social graph. The protocol was created to give developers one thing to implement instead of a collection of different technologies.

## How do you make use of it?

What you need to do to turn your web pages into graph object is to add metadata to your page. There are a minimum of four properties that are required on every page:

```
og:title - This is the title that will appear within the graph
og:type - The type of the object, for example music.song, music.album or video.tv_show
og:image - URL to an image that will be used within the graph
og:url - URL that will be used in your graph
```

In addition to the properties above there are optional metadata that is recommended to use:

- og:audio
- og:description
- og:determiner
- og:locale
- og:locale:alternate
- og:site_name
- og:video
